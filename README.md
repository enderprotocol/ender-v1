# Technical Documentation for EnderBond Contract

 ## Overview

The EnderBond contract is a Solidity smart contract designed to implement bonding functionality for multiple tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to deposit their assets into a bond, which locks the funds for a specified period and provides potential rewards. 
Contract Structure

### The EnderBond contract is structured as follows:

- Initialization: The contract is initialized with parameters like the END token address, Lido contract address, and Oracle contract address. The owner of the contract can set other parameters like the minimum deposit amount, transaction fees, and bond yield base rate.

- Address Management: The contract includes functions to set and retrieve addresses related to various external contracts and services, such as the EnderTreasury, END token, BondNFT, EnderSignature, Lido, and more.

- Bondable Tokens: The contract maintains a mapping of bondable tokens, allowing the owner to specify which tokens can be used for bonding.

- Deposit: Users can deposit funds into a bond using the `deposit` function. They can specify the principal amount, maturity date (lock time), bond fee, and the token they want to deposit (including ETH). The contract checks for various conditions, such as the minimum deposit amount, bondable token status, and bond fee validity.

- Withdraw: Once a bond has matured, users can withdraw their funds by calling the `withdraw` function. This function performs checks to ensure that the bond has not already been withdrawn, the maturity date has passed, and the caller owns the bond.

- Reward Distribution: The contract handles reward distribution based on various factors. Users can collect rewards using the `claimStakingReward` and `claimRefractionRewards` functions.

- Epoch Updates: The contract includes functions for updating reward shares and bond yield shares at the beginning of each epoch. These functions calculate and set the reward shares based on the amount of rewards and principles.

- Fees and Index Management: The contract deducts transaction fees from transfers and maintains various indexes for tracking reward shares and yield shares.

- Fallback Function: The contract includes a fallback function to accept ETH transfers.

### Key Concepts

- Bondable Tokens: Tokens that can be used for bonding are specified in the `bondableTokens` mapping.

- Bond Fee: Users can set a bond fee when depositing funds, which affects the rewards and yields.

- Maturity: The maturity date is the lock time for the bond. Funds can only be withdrawn after this date.

- Reward Shares: Users earn rewards based on the reward shares, which are updated at the beginning of each epoch.

- Yield Share: The bond yield share index represents the growth of rewards over time based on bond principles and yield rates.

- Staking Rewards: Users can earn rewards for staking their bonds using the `claimStakingReward` function.

- Refraction Rewards: Users can earn rewards for bonding and holding assets using the `claimRefractionRewards` function.

### External Contracts and Interfaces

The EnderBond contract interacts with various external contracts and interfaces, including:

- EnderTreasury: The EnderTreasury contract is used to handle the deposit and withdrawal of funds, including the management of rewards.

- BondNFT: The BondNFT contract is used for minting and managing NFTs that represent bonds.


- Lido: The Lido contract is used to manage ETH deposits.

- EnderOracle: The EnderOracle contract provides price data for ETH and END tokens.

function getInterest(uint256 maturity) public view returns (uint256 rate)

Description: This function calculates the interest rate based on the provided maturity value. The interest rate is used in various calculations within the contract. It adjusts the base interest rate using a `maturityModifier` based on specific maturity conditions.

Parameters:
- `maturity` (uint256): The maturity date of a bond in days for which the interest rate is to be calculated.

function deposit(
       uint256 principal,
       uint256 maturity,
       uint256 bondFee,
       address token
   ) external payable nonReentrant returns (uint256 tokenId)

Description-
  The deposit function in your code is responsible for allowing users to deposit funds into the system. The function can accept either Ether (ETH) or a custom token (referred to as stEth). Here's a detailed description of what the function does:


### Input Parameters:

uint256 principal: The amount the user wants to deposit.
uint256 maturity: The maturity period in days, which must be between 7 and 365 days.
uint256 bondFee: The fee percentage associated with the bond deposit, ranging from 0 to 100.
address token: The address of the token being deposited (0x0 for ETH).

### Pre-Checks:

The function begins by checking if the provided principal is greater than or equal to a minimum deposit amount (minDepositAmount). If it's not, it reverts, indicating that the amount is invalid.
It checks whether the maturity is within the valid range of 7 to 365 days and reverts if not.
If a specific token is provided (token is not 0x0), it checks if the token is allowed for bonding (bondableTokens). If not, it reverts, indicating that the token is not bondable.
It validates that the bondFee is within the allowed range of 0 to 100. If it's not, the function reverts.

### Token Transfer:

If the deposit is in Ether (ETH), it checks if the msg.value (the amount of Ether sent with the transaction) matches the specified principal. If not, it reverts.
It then transfers the Ether to the contract's lido address and submits it.
If the deposit is in a token other than ETH, it transfers the specified principal from the user's address to the contract's endTreasury address.

### Deposit Handling:

The function calls a private _deposit function, passing the principal, maturity, token, and bondFee as arguments.
It mints a new non-fungible token (NFT) and assigns it to the user. This NFT represents the user's bond in the system.
It calculates and records various financial metrics and indexes for the bond, including rewards, shares, and principal amounts.

### Calculation and Indexing:

The function calculates and records the rewardSharePerUserIndex, rewardSharePerUserIndexSend, and userBondYieldShareIndex, which are used to track the user's claimed amounts and share in rewards.
It updates the total deposit and total reward principal values.

### Interest and Principal Calculation:

The function calculates the interest based on the maturity period.
It calculates the depositPrincipal, which is a portion of the deposit that contributes to the yield. This value is based on the interest, bond fee, and the provided principal.

### Storage and Record Keeping:

It stores various bond-related information, such as the bond's principal, creation timestamp, maturity period, associated token, bond fee, deposit principal, and reward principle.
Finally, the function emits a Deposit event to notify that a deposit has been made.





  function withdraw(uint256 tokenId) external nonReentrant

### Withdraw Function:

The withdraw function and its accompanying _withdraw private function allow users to withdraw their funds and rewards associated with a specific bond identified by its tokenId.



 - Parameters:
      - `tokenId`: The ID of the bond token to be withdrawn.

Withdraw(uint256 tokenId):

This public function enables external users to initiate the withdrawal process for a specific bond, identified by its tokenId.

_withdraw(uint256 _tokenId) [Private]:

This private function performs the actual withdrawal process for the given tokenId. It's used internally by the withdraw function.

### Withdrawal Process:

Here's what happens during the withdrawal process:

The function retrieves the bond information associated with the provided tokenId.

Several conditions are checked to ensure a valid withdrawal:

If the bond has already been withdrawn (bond.withdrawn), it reverts, indicating that the bond has already been withdrawn.
It verifies that the owner of the bond NFT (represented by the _tokenId) is the same as the caller of the function (msg.sender). If not, it reverts, indicating that the caller is not the bond owner.
It checks if the current timestamp is less than the bond's maturity date (bond.startTime + bond.maturity). If not, it reverts, indicating that the bond has not matured yet.

If all conditions are met, the function updates the bond's status by marking it as withdrawn (bond.withdrawn = true), indicating that the bond has been successfully withdrawn.

It initiates the withdrawal from the endTreasury contract, passing an EndRequest struct with relevant information, including the user's address, the bond's associated token, and the principal amount. Additionally, it triggers the getLoopCount function, which is used to calculate the amount required for that particular maturity.

The function calculates the reward the user will receive for the bond using the calculateBondRewardAmount function.

It updates the dayBondYieldShareIndex for the maturity date of the bond with the userBondYieldShareIndex associated with the bond. This index is implemented to prevent the user from withdrawing extra rewards after the withdrawal.

The function transfers the calculated reward to the user's address using the mintEndToUser function from the endTreasury contract.

It checks if the user needs to claim refraction rewards or staking rewards manually. If the rewardShareIndex does not match rewardSharePerUserIndex[_tokenId], the user need not to claim refraction rewards using the claimRefractionRewards function. Similarly, if rewardSharePerUserIndexSend[_tokenId] does not match rewardShareIndexSend, the user need not to claim staking rewards using the claimStakingReward function.

The function updates various accounting variables, including subtracting the userBondPrincipalAmount associated with the bond from totalBondPrincipalAmount.

It sets the userBondPrincipalAmount for the _tokenId to zero and deletes the userBondYieldShareIndex associated with it.

It adjusts the amountRequired by subtracting the principal amount of the bond.
